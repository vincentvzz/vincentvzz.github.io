          <div>Overview:</div>
          <p>This website provides a pretty simple view of what jobs users have saved, as well as adding new jobs.</p>
          <div>Development Process:</div>
          <p>I first set up the database, then tried to make functions of logging in users first. After that, I worked on how to add jobs and update values in the database. I realized that the logging in system also needs to consider signing up. Therefore, I treat typing in new usernames as sign up and automatically create one document in the database.</p>

          <div>Issues:</div>
          <p>One of the biggest issues is to figure out the logic of changing data in firestore. I overcomed that difficulties by reading documentations and skimming some stackoverflow questions.</p>
          <div>Ideas and Future:</div>
          <ol>
            <li>UI can be improved.</li>
            <li>More functions such as delete jobs, or edit current job lists, can be added.</li>
          </ol>
          <div>Kudos:</div>
          <ul>
            <li>Documentation of firestore.</li>
            <li>Multiple pages of stackoverflow that talks about querying in firestore.</li>
          </ul>
          <div>Project Scope</div>
          <p>I decided to remove edition on my original extension, because I spent too much time on researching how to import firebase into the chrome extension and had a hard time implementing the module import (although I have written the logic of adding jobs to the database using the extension).</p>
          <div>Time Management</div>
          <p>I messed up a little bit of this part, as I have other projects due approximately at the same time period. Also, as I mentioned above, I didn't expect myself to spend too much time on module import issue. Maybe I should post that info in discord once I complete my new project scope.</p>
          <div>Implementation Plan</div>
          <p>Right now I will spend more time on polishing UI and thinking on more functionalities that are related to job search. Such changes are largely based on the changes made by project scope.</p>
