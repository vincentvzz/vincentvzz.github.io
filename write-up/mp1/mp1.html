          <div>Overview:</div>
          <p>This extension helps you quickly add the job description links to your list by giving them company names. You can download the whole list as a csv as you wish. I utilize click events to perform adding links to the list and download the whole list. I also use some google APIs to help temporarily store the data list in the browser.</p>
          <p>To use the extension, download the extension; then go to chrome://extensions, open developer mode, and load unpacked extension, which you need to select the file location of downloaded extension.</p>

          <div>Development Process:</div>
          <p>I first created a general extension file structure with the help of hello world demo code. I changed some css to make it look user-friendly. Then I started implementing the interaction part. I created the input textbox for typing company name as my primary step, followed by adding a button to add the current link to a data list. I used a google API for getting current tab's url. After that, I used another google API called chrome storage to make a local storage of a list of job urls that user adds so far. Finally, I added download button and implemented the download feature. I tested each feature individually to make sure that there is no functionality issues. Below is a screenshot of a non-appealing but functional extension (i.e. half-constructed extension).</p>

          <div>Issue:</div>
          <p>One issue about the extension while developing is to figure out how to make file download happen. I searched online and found that I need to use a class called Blob. After reading the code via Geeksforgeeks, I made some changes of that sample code to accomodate my dictionary of job urls so that it can form the csv structure that I want. Luckily, it worked once I finished the implementation.</p>
          <div>Ideas and Future:</div>
          <ol>
            <li>More attributes can be added, such as job name, job level, etc.</li>
            <li>Maybe we can add auto-search jobs and recommend these jobs to the user.</li>
            <li>User can preview the current job url list via extension.</li>
          </ol>
