          <div>Overview:</div>
          <p>This website provides a pretty simple view of what jobs users have saved, as well as adding new jobs and deleting jobs.</p>
          <div>Development Process:</div>
          <p>Based on the prototype, I polished a little bit for the website UI, especially for the job list. Also, I added delete job functionality by binding events on dynamic elements "delete", which is generated through lint-html.</p>

          <div>Issues:</div>
          <p>The main issue is on the UI, where I would like to add some color for each data entry. Therefore, I did a little research on how to make interphase colors between rows. I got the result that an easy css can accomplish that task. I also include that in my cheatsheet.</p>
          <div>Ideas and Future:</div>
          <ol>
            <li>More functionalities, especially edit current job lists.</li>
            <li>Can be more interactive with the job description link. E.g., automatically get information based on the job description link.</li>
            <li>A more secure login/sign up way should be utilized.</li>
          </ol>
          <div>Kudos:</div>
          <ul>
            <li>Kudos to all of the css documentation online (and chatgpt for giving me advice on css grid).</li>
