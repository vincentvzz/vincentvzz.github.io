          <div>Overview:</div>
          <p>The galleries show 6 drawings that I made from simple to complex. I intended to make drawings focus more on interactions and fun by mimicing drawings as games. (Click gallery tab on the top to view gif and screenshot)</p>
          <div>Development Process:</div>
          <p>For the first three graphs, I made some simple geometries and movements as experiments to prepare for next three graphs. For the first graph, I made a nested loop to repeat drawing squares. For the second one, I added a random number in a condition statement so that it will show about 50% squares randomly throughout the canvas. For the third one, I added the movement for the square to bounce once hit the edges by controlling its movement both horizontally and vertically (let the movement times 1 or -1 to change directions).</p>
          <p>For the fourth one, I tried to make a panel that can let user controls by tracking mouse position. It serves the same thing as edges in the third graph. For the fifth one, I just add a sound effect once user successfully bounces the circle by checking if the mouse position "hits" the center of the circle with certain error range (+/- several pixels).</p>
          <p>For the sixth graph, I want to make a console that mimics gamepad, which user can control the movement of the circle. I also make this game similar to Gluttonous Snake, where user controls the circle to "eat" square and turn circle bigger. I utilize the "hits" functionality from the fifth graph, as well as reset the position of the circle once it hits the edges.</p>
          <div>Issue:</div>
          <p>One of the issues is how to handle the "hit" functionality. I first start by thinking some condition statement that need to check whether the mouse position is the same as the center of certain figures. Later I realized that it is pretty hard to check whether it works or not because the condition is too limited. Therefore, I made error ranges for hits to make it easier to be triggered.</p>
          <div>Ideas and Future:</div>
          <ol>
            <li>I need to make the graphs/games more visual appealing.</li>
            <li>I can add more different interactions to mimic Gluttonous Snake game, such as some ways that can make the player loses.</li>
            <li>More sound effects is definitely needed to make the game more friendly, as currently I only use one sound effect.</li>
          </ol>
